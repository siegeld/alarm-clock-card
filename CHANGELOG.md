## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-10

### 🚀 Major Architecture Refactoring

#### Home Assistant Coordinator Pattern
- **Migrated to DataUpdateCoordinator** - Complete refactoring to use proper HA coordinator pattern
- **Centralized State Management** - All alarm logic now centralized in AlarmClockCoordinator
- **Thin Entity Wrappers** - Entities now just expose coordinator data via standard HA patterns
- **Standard HA Structure** - Follows Home Assistant best practices for integration architecture

#### Unique ID-Based Entity Discovery
- **Rename-Proof Architecture** - Card now uses unique_id patterns instead of entity names
- **Clean Unique ID Patterns** - Simplified from `alarm_clock_{entry_id}` to just `{entry_id}` for main entity
- **Registry-Based Discovery** - Works even when entities don't have states yet
- **Future-Proof Design** - Entity renames won't break card functionality

#### Real-Time Responsiveness
- **1-Second Update Interval** - Changed coordinator from 30-second to 1-second updates
- **Immediate Service Call Refresh** - All service calls trigger instant coordinator refresh
- **Responsive UI Updates** - Card now responds immediately to button clicks (<1 second)
- **Double-Layer Responsiveness** - Both backend push and frontend pull for instant feedback

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

#### Entity Discovery Issues
- **Fixed Card Entity Detection** - Resolved "Could not find coordinator" errors
- **Registry vs State Handling** - Fixed entities existing in registry but not having states
- **Fallback Entity Values** - Added fallback handling for entities without states
- **Platform Detection** - Fixed entity platform detection issues

#### UI Responsiveness
- **Eliminated 15-Second Delays** - Fixed slow response when clicking "Enable Alarm"
- **Immediate Visual Feedback** - All card interactions now provide instant feedback
- **Force Refresh Logic** - Added immediate refresh after all service calls

### ✨ Technical Improvements

#### Code Architecture
- **Proper HA Patterns** - Now follows Home Assistant coordinator best practices
- **Single Source of Truth** - Coordinator manages all state, entities just expose it
- **Better Error Handling** - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Cleaner Entity Structure** - Simplified entity relationships and dependencies

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Real-Time Updates** - 1-second coordinator refresh for live status monitoring
- **Efficient State Propagation** - Optimized data flow between coordinator and entities
- **Reduced Entity Coupling** - Entities no longer directly communicate with each other

### 🔧 Breaking Changes

#### Internal Architecture
- **Coordinator Required** - Entities now require coordinator for proper operation
- **Entity Dependencies** - Some entity initialization order changes
- **Unique ID Format** - Main entity unique_id simplified (internal change)

### 📝 Migration Notes

- **Restart Required** - Restart Home Assistant after updating to apply coordinator changes
- **Browser Refresh** - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to load updated card
- **No Config Changes** - All existing alarm settings preserved
- **Performance Improvement** - Should notice much faster UI responsiveness

### 🎯 What's Improved

- ✅ **Instant Responsiveness** - Card responds in ~1 second instead of 15 seconds
- ✅ **Rename-Proof Design** - Renaming entities won't break card functionality  
- ✅ **Proper HA Architecture** - Follows Home Assistant coordinator best practices
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates** - Live status monitoring with 1-second precision
- ✅ **Better Error Handling** - More robust entity discovery and state management
- ✅ **Future-Proof** - Clean architecture for easier maintenance and features

## [1.1.3] - 2025-07-09

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

#### Dismiss Button Functionality  
- **Fixed Dismiss Button Not Working** - Restore immediate alarm dismissal functionality
- **Proper State Flow** - Dismiss now immediately sets state to OFF, then calculates next alarm
- **Auto-dismiss Fix** - Applied same fix to auto-dismiss timer functionality

### 🎯 What's Fixed

**The Problem:**
- Dismiss button stopped working after v1.1.2 recurring alarm fix
- Clicking dismiss did nothing - alarm kept ringing
- Auto-dismiss also broken

**Root Cause:**
- Removed immediate state change to `ALARM_STATE_OFF` in dismiss methods
- Relied entirely on `_async_update_alarm_state()` to set new state
- This broke immediate dismiss functionality

**The Solution:**
- Restored immediate `self._state = ALARM_STATE_OFF` 
- Write state to HA immediately so user sees alarm dismissed
- Then recalculate next alarm occurrence for recurring functionality
- Update sensors with new next alarm time

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Correct Dismiss Flow:**
1. **Immediately set state to OFF** (stops current alarm)  
2. **Write state to HA immediately** (user sees alarm dismissed)
3. **Then recalculate next alarm occurrence** (for recurring)
4. **Update sensors** with new next alarm

Applied to both `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` methods.

### 📝 Impact

This fixes the critical regression where dismiss functionality was completely broken. Now dismiss works immediately AND alarms still recur properly.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-09

### 🚨 Critical Bug Fix

#### Recurring Alarm Functionality
- **Fixed Critical Recurring Alarm Bug** - Alarms now properly advance to next occurrence after dismiss/auto-dismiss
- **Immediate State Recalculation** - `async_dismiss()` and `_async_auto_dismiss()` now call `_async_update_alarm_state()`
- **Sensor Synchronization** - Both dismiss methods trigger `_async_update_related_entities()` for real-time updates

### 🎯 What's Fixed

**Before (Broken):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM → User dismisses → Alarm stays OFF permanently
- Next alarm sensor shows "None" 
- Alarm never rings again until manually re-enabled

**After (Fixed):**
- Alarm rings Monday 7:00 AM → User dismisses → Immediately arms for Tuesday 7:00 AM
- Next alarm sensor immediately shows "Tuesday at 7:00 AM"
- Alarm properly recurs as expected

### 📝 Impact

This was a **critical functionality bug** that made alarms behave as one-time instead of recurring. All users should update immediately to restore proper recurring alarm behavior.

### 🔧 Technical Details

- Added `await self._async_update_alarm_state()` to both dismiss methods
- Added `await self._async_update_related_entities()` for sensor updates
- Ensures alarm state machine properly advances to next scheduled occurrence
- Maintains all timing and script execution logic

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-09

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

#### UI/Layout Improvements
- **Fixed Day Button Layout** - Resolved Sunday button getting cut off on narrow cards
- **Responsive Design** - Switched from CSS grid to flexbox for better space distribution
- **Optimized Spacing** - Reduced gaps and font sizes for better fit on all card widths

#### Sensor Synchronization
- **Fixed Sensor Updates** - Next alarm and time until sensors now update immediately when alarm time or days change
- **Real-time Recalculation** - Sensors properly recalculate values without requiring page refresh
- **Direct Entity References** - Improved sensor update mechanism using stored entity references

### ✨ Technical Improvements

#### Layout System
- **Flexbox Implementation** - Changed day buttons from `grid` to `flex` with `justify-content: space-between`
- **Calculated Sizing** - Added `max-width: calc((100% - 12px) / 7)` for precise button sizing
- **Responsive Spacing** - Reduced gap from 8px → 2px and font-size from 12px → 10px

#### Entity Management
- **Sensor Registration** - Sensors now register themselves with main entity during setup
- **Force Updates** - Added direct `async_write_ha_state()` calls for immediate sensor updates
- **Better Synchronization** - Improved communication between main entity and sensor entities

### 🎯 What's Fixed

- ✅ All 7 day buttons now fit properly on narrow cards without Sunday cutoff
- ✅ Next alarm sensor updates immediately when time or days change
- ✅ Time until sensor recalculates countdown in real-time
- ✅ No page refresh required for sensor updates
- ✅ Improved responsive layout across all card sizes
